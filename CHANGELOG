1.0.0 / 2017-06-22

* Breaking changes

  * No more Array#multiple_timeframes_gaps_left_by (who knows what that was for)

* Enhancements

  * Only uses active_support/core_ext/date
  * Convert to rspec, modernize

0.2.1 / 2012-04-24

* Bug fixes

  * Stop defining Timeframe#to_json... it's conventional to only define #as_json

0.2.0 / 2012-04-24

* Breaking changes

  * Use ISO8601 for JSON output. No sense in coming up with our own structure. Timeframe.parse will still understand the old startDate/endDate hash structure.

* Enhancements

  * New MultiJson syntax
  * Simplify and DRY.
  * Tested on MRI 1.8, MRI 1.9, and JRuby 1.6.7+
