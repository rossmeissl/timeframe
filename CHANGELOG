0.2.0 / 2012-04-24

* Breaking changes

  * Use ISO8601 for JSON output. No sense in coming up with our own structure. Timeframe.parse will still understand the old startDate/endDate hash structure.

* Enhancements

  * New MultiJson syntax
  * Simplify and DRY.
  * Tested on MRI 1.8, MRI 1.9, and JRuby 1.6.7+
